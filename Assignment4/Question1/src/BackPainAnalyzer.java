 * Assignment 4, Question 1: Complete the implementation of a DecisionTree, introduced 
 * in Chapter 19. This will require completing a number of methods from the source 
 * code for this chapter, particularly for LinkedBinaryTree. Your initial test should 
 * be the BackPainAnalyzer output from Listing 19.6 on page 746. Show test cases for 
 * at least two other correct traversals of this tree.
 * 
 * Develop and demonstrate another decision tre that is more complex than the BachPainAnalyzer 
 * tree. Provide at least two correct traversals of this tree as well.
